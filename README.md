# Data Science Portfolio

Here's a small repository with a few data analysis projects I've developed to streamline and improve SEO analyses.

The main purpose of the projects is to unpack complex events to describe and identify patterns or trends in the ever-evolving SEO landscape (see Exploratory Data Analysis).

## Caveats

This is a side-hustle project to upskill my career from SEO to data analyst - ambitiously NLP machine learning pro.
Hence, the portfolio is a bit messy and some projects are rough whilst others are rogue.
